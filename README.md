# Portfolio
This is a small basic project made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
It has a bit of animation and colour grading.
It also redirects to my linkedin, leetcode and github ids.
I will modify it more in the coming few days and add more animation along with images and logos. 
I also tried to add my resume to it but due to some file error it wasn't loading on my portfolio so I'll work on that as well.
