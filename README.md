# Portfolio
This is a small basic project made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
It has a bit of animation and colour grading.
It also redirects to my linkedin, leetcode and github ids.
I will modify it more in the coming few days and add more animation along with images and logos, currently the image is floating a little bit I tried to add a feauture where you can zoom-in in the picture but the picture covered the whole screen even after trying multiple times I couldn't resolve it, so I had to remove it at the end(will try to make it work). 
I also tried to add my resume to it but due to some file error it wasn't loading on my portfolio so I'll work on that as well.
